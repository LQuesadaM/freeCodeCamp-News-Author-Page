# freeCodeCamp News Author Page

This freeCodeCamp author page project will show how to use the fetch method, and then dynamically update the DOM to display the fetched data. I will learn how to fetch data from an external API, and then work with asynchronous JavaScript.

This project will also show how to paginate your data so you can batch load the results.
